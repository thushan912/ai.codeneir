# Tab Visibility Fix - Mobile Navigation

## Problem Identified
The mobile tabs ("Text Generation" and "Image Generation") were appearing briefly during page load but then disappearing under the sticky header after the page finished loading.

## Root Cause
- The header has `sticky top-0 z-50` positioning
- The tabs were not properly positioned relative to the sticky header
- After page load completion, the tabs were being repositioned incorrectly

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Tab Positioning Fix
- Added `sticky top-[64px] z-40` to the tabs container
- This ensures tabs stick exactly 64px from the top (below the header)
- Used z-index 40 (lower than header's z-50) to maintain proper layering

### 2. Enhanced Tab Styling
- Updated tab labels from "Chat"/"Create" to "Text Generation"/"Image Generation"
- Added stronger visual indicators with gradients and borders
- Improved contrast and visibility with better color schemes

### 3. Layout Structure Improvements
- Added `relative` positioning to main container
- Ensured proper flex layout hierarchy
- Added z-index layers to tab triggers for better interaction

## Technical Details

### Key CSS Classes Applied:
```css
/* Header */
sticky top-0 z-50

/* Tabs Container */
sticky top-[64px] z-40

/* Tab Triggers */
relative z-10
```

### Files Modified:
1. `src/components/MobileTabsWrapper.tsx` - Tab positioning and styling
2. `src/components/Header.tsx` - Header positioning optimization
3. `src/app/page.tsx` - Layout structure improvements

## Testing Results
- ✅ Tabs remain visible after page load
- ✅ Proper positioning below header
- ✅ Maintained sticky behavior on scroll
- ✅ Clear labeling as "Text Generation" and "Image Generation"
- ✅ No layout conflicts or z-index issues

## User Experience Impact
- Users can now clearly see both tab options after page load
- Smooth transitions between text and image generation modes
- Consistent navigation experience across mobile devices
- No more disappearing tabs issue
