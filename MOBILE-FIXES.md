# Mobile Responsive Fixes - AI Text & Image Generator

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Mobile Tab Visibility Issue
**Problem**: On mobile devices, users couldn't see both "Text Generation" and "Image Generation" tabs properly.

**Solution**: Enhanced the `MobileTabsWrapper` component with better responsive design and improved tab visibility.

### 2. Header Disappearing on Scroll
**Problem**: The header was hiding when users scrolled down, making navigation difficult.

**Solution**: 
- Added `sticky top-0 z-50` classes to the Header component
- Ensured the header stays visible at all times on mobile
- Improved mobile navigation accessibility

### 3. Generate Button Below the Fold
**Problem**: Users had to scroll down to see the "Generate Image" button on mobile devices, creating poor UX.

**Solution**: 
- **Mobile Layout**: Created a completely separate mobile-optimized layout for the ImageStudio component
- **Fixed Bottom Button**: Positioned the generate button at the bottom of the screen with a gradient background
- **Compact Form**: Redesigned the form to be more compact on mobile
- **Sticky Positioning**: The generate button is always visible without requiring scrolling

## Implementation Details
